## 1. Architecture Overview

- Monorepo with a single Next.js app (SSR enabled)
- Loosely coupled backend logic, clear separation of concerns
- Designed for scalability, maintainability, and future migration

  C -->|DB/API| D[(Database/External APIs)]
```

---

## 2. Project Structure & Code Organization

- `/app` or `/pages`: Next.js pages (SSR, server components)
- `/components`: React components
- `/lib/services`: Business logic (pure functions/classes)
- `/lib/types`: Shared TypeScript types/interfaces
- `/lib/db.ts` or `/lib/clients/`: Database/external API access
- `/public`: Static assets

---

## 3. Design Practices & Decoupling

- All business logic in `/lib/services`, framework-agnostic
- Thin API handlers and SSR functions delegate to services
- Shared types/interfaces in `/lib/types`
- No direct imports from frontend to backend-only code
- Use environment variables for config/secrets

---

## 4. SSR & Data Fetching

- Use SSR (`getServerSideProps`, server components) for dynamic data
- Fetch data directly from service functions in SSR/API routes
- Avoid unnecessary API endpoints if data can be fetched server-side
- Use static generation for public/non-personalized pages

---

## 5. Authentication & Authorization

- Use HTTP-only, Secure cookies for session tokens
- Validate session and user identity in every SSR request
- Fetch and render only the authenticated user's data
- Enforce authorization in the service layer
- Redirect unauthenticated users to login
- Never expose other users' data in SSR props
- Use scalable infrastructure for personalized SSR

---

## 6. Debugging Practices

- Use descriptive logging in service and API layers
- Leverage Next.js error overlays and stack traces
- Use source maps for server and client code
- Document common debugging workflows (e.g., tracing SSR data flow, session validation)
- Recommend tools: VSCode debugger, Chrome DevTools, Node.js inspector

---

## 7. Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all service functions in `/lib/services`
- Integration tests for API routes and SSR data fetching
- Use type-safe mocks/stubs for database/external API access
- Ensure 100% type coverage for shared types/interfaces
- Recommended tools: Jest, Testing Library, msw (mock service worker), TypeScript

---

## 8. CI/CD Pipeline

- Single pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to:
  - Install dependencies
  - Run linting and type checks
  - Run all tests (unit, integration)
  - Build the Next.js app
  - Deploy to Cloud Run or GKE
- Use environment variables for all secrets/configuration
- Fail the pipeline if any lint, type, or test step fails

---

## 9. Deployment

- Deploy the Next.js app as a container to Cloud Run or GKE
- Use a single build artifact for both frontend and backend
- Ensure environment variables are securely managed in the deployment platform
- Monitor deployment health and set up alerts for failures

---

## 10. Future-Proofing & Migration

- Keep business logic and types decoupled from Next.js-specific code
- Prepare for migration to a standalone backend (REST/gRPC) if needed
- Document any deviations from this plan and justify them in project documentation
